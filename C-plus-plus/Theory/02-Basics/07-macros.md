# Macros

Macros are piece of code in a program that is given some name.

WHen the compiler encounters the name, the compiler replaces the name with the actual values or piece of code.

The `#define` directive is used to define a macro.

# Note

There is no semicolon at the end of the micro definition.

```cpp

// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>

// Macro definition
#define LIMIT 5
```
