# Similarities between C and C++

- Both the languages have a similar syntax.

- Code structure of both the languages are same.
- The compilation of both the languages is similar.
- They share the same basic syntax. Nearly all of C’s operators and keywords are also present in C++ and do the same thing.
- C++ has a slightly extended grammar than C, but the basic grammar is the same.
- Basic memory model of both is very close to the hardware.
- Same notions of stack, heap, file-scope and static variables are present in both the languages.

| developed by                                       | C was developed by Dennis Ritchie between the year 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs.                                             | C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.                                                                                               |
| OOP                                                | C does no support polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance which means that C does not support object oriented programming. | C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance because it is an object oriented programming language.                              |
| Relation                                           | C is (mostly) a subset of C++.                                                                                                  | C++ is (mostly) a superset of C.                                                                                                              |
| procedural programming                             | For the development of code, C supports procedural programming.                                                                 | C++ is known as hybrid language because C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming paradigms.                               |
| Data and functions                                 | Data and functions are separated in C because it is a procedural programming language.                                          | Data and functions are encapsulated together in form of an object in C++.                                                                     |
| Data hidden                                        | C does not support information hiding.                                                                                          | Data is hidden by the Encapsulation to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended.                                        |
| Built-in & user-defined data types supports        | Built-in data types are supported in C.                                                                                           | Built-in & user-defined data types are supported in C++.                                                                                       |
| function driven language or object driven language | C is a function driven language because C is a procedural programming language.                                                 | C++ is an object driven language because it is an object oriented programming.                                                                |

| Focus                                              | Instead of focusing on data, C focuses on method or process.                                                                    | C++ focuses on data instead of focusing on method or procedure.                                                                               |
| Memory Allocation                                  | C provides malloc() and calloc() functions for dynamic memory allocation, and free() for memory de-allocation.                  | C++ provides new operator for memory allocation and delete operator for memory de-allocation.                                                 |
