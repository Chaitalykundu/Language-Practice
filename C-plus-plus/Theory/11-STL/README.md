# Indroduction

- STL = Standard Template Library

- STL is Standard Template Library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of container or classes.

- STL has 4 components:
  - Algorithms
  - Containers
  - Functors
  - Iterators

It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.

It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. Working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

One of the key benefits of the STL is that ***it provides a way to write generic, reusable code*** that can be applied to different data types. This means that you can write an algorithm once, and then use it with different types of data without having to write separate code for each type.

# Algorithm

The algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements.

They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers.

# Containers

Containers can be described as the objects that hold the data of the same type. Containers are used to implement different data structures for example ***arrays, list, trees***, etc.

&nbsp;

### Classification of containers

1. Sequence containers
2. Associative containers
3. Derived containers or Container Adaptors
4. Unordered Associative Containers

# Advantages of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

- ***Reusability***: One of the key advantages of the STL is that it provides a way to write generic, reusable code that can be applied to different data types. This can lead to more efficient and maintainable code.

- ***Efficient algorithms***: Many of the algorithms and data structures in the STL are implemented using optimized algorithms, which can result in faster execution times compared to custom code.

- ***Improved code readability***: The STL provides a consistent and well-documented way of working with data, which can make your code easier to understand and maintain.

- ***Large community of users***: The STL is widely used, which means that there is a large community of developers who can provide support and resources, such as tutorials and forums.

# Disadvantages of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

- ***Learning curve***: The STL can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners, due to its complex syntax and use of advanced features like iterators and function objects.

- ***Lack of control***: When using the STL, you have to rely on the implementation provided by the library, which can limit your control over certain aspects of your code.

- ***Performance***: In some cases, using the STL can result in slower execution times compared to custom code, especially when dealing with small amounts of data.
