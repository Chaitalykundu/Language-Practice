# Variable

A variable is a storage place that has some memory allocated to it.

It is used to store some form of data.

Different types of variables require different amounts of memory.

# Variable Declaration 

In C++, we can declare variables as follows:

* **data_type**: Type of the data that can be stored in this variable. It can be int, float, double, etc.

* **variable_name**: Name given to the variable.

&nbsp;


# Syntax : 

```cpp
    data_type variable_name;
```

&nbsp;


# Example:

```cpp
    int x;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Assign value in variable

We can assign the value in this variable by using two ways :

* By using variable initialization.
* By taking input

&nbsp;

# Syntax :

```cpp
data_type variable_name=value;
```

&nbsp;

## Example:

```cpp
int x = 20;
```

# Rules for defining variables in C++

* You can’t begin with a number. Ex-9a can't be a variable, but a9 can be a variable. 

* Spaces and special characters except for underscore(_) are not allowed.

* C++ keywords (reserved words) must not be used as a variable name.

* C++ is case-sensitive, meaning a variable with the name ‘A’ is different from a variable with the name ‘a’. (Difference in the upper-case and lower-case holds true).
