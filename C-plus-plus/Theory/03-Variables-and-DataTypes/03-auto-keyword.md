# auto keyword in c++

The `auto` keyword specifies that the type of the declared variable will automatically be deduced from its initializer.  It would set the variable type to initialize that variableâ€™s value type or set the function return type as the value to be returned.

# Example:

```cpp
 auto a = 11          // will set the variable a as int type 
 auto b = 7.65        //will set the variable b as float 
 auto c = "abcdefg"   // will set the variable c as string
```
