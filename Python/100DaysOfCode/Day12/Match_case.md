- match case = switch case

* A match statement will compare a given variable’s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern.

* The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.

* If one condition matches, the code will terminate

* The match case consists of three main entities :

  - The match keyword
  - One or more case clauses
  - Expression for each case

- Syntax:

  ```
  match variable_name:
    case ‘pattern1’ : //statement1
    case ‘pattern2’ : //statement2
    …
    case ‘pattern n’ : //statement n
  ```
