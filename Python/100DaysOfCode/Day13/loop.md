Sometimes a programmer wants to execute a group of statements a certain number of times. This can be done using loops. Based on this loops are further classified into following main types;

    * for loop
    * while loop

- we can use loops for string, lists, sets and dictionaries.

## range():

What if we do not want to iterate over a sequence? What if we want to use for loop for a specific number of times?

Here, we can use the range() function.

- Exercise 1 :

  ```
  for k in range(4,9):
  print(k)
  ```

- Exercise 2 :

  ```
  for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
  ```

  here 1 is starting point, 10 is ending point-1, and 2 is diff
