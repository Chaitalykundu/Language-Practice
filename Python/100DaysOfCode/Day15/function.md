## Functions

- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task whenever it is called.

* In bigger programs, where we have large amounts of code, it is advisable to create or use existing functions that make the program flow organized and neat.

* There are two types of functions:

  - Built-in functions
  - User-defined functions

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Built-in functions:

- These functions are defined and pre-coded in python. Some examples of built-in functions are as follows:

> min(), max(), len(), sum(), type(), range(), dict(), list(), tuple(), set(), print(), etc.

&nbsp;

## User-defined functions:

- We can create functions to perform specific tasks as per our needs. Such functions are called user-defined functions.

&nbsp;

### Syntax:

```
 def function_name(parameters):
     pass
```

- here pass means it will be written later
  &nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Create a function using the def keyword, followed by a function name, followed by a paranthesis (()) and a colon(:).

* Any parameters and arguments should be placed within the parentheses.
* Rules to naming function are similar to that of naming variables.
* Any statements and other code within the function should be indented.

## Calling a function:

We call a function by giving the function name, followed by parameters (if any) in the parenthesis.
