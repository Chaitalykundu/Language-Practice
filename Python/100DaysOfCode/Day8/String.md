- A string is a data type used in programming, that is used to represent text rather than numbers.

- A string is a sequence of characters and can contain letters, numbers, symbols and even spaces.

* Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

* Sometimes, the user might need to put quotation marks in between the strings. Example, consider the sentence: `He said, “I want to eat an apple”.` Or `He said, “I want to eat an apple”` To solve this

```
print('He said, "I want to eat an apple".')
print("He said, 'I want to eat an apple'.")
```

- You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes. Ex :

```
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""

print(a)
```

- Strings are immutable

### immutable

Immutable means **_unchanged_**. If we declare any string and change any charracter, then the main string will remain unchanged.
